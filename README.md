# RESTful-API-Quote-Generator
A client-side application built with React that consumes a RESTful API. 
The application is making an HTTP GET request to the "https://api.quotable.io/random" endpoint using the Axios library. This endpoint is provided by the "quotable" API, which is a RESTful API that returns a random quote when accessed.
